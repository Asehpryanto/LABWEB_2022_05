	<div class="content">
		John Harris (born 29 July 1948 in London, England) is a British artist and illustrator,
    known for working in the science fiction genre. His paintings have been used on book covers
    for many authors, including Orson Scott Card,Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov, Frederik Pohl,
    Ben Bova, Wilbur Smith, Jack Vance, Ann Leckie, and John Scalzi.His work has covered many 
    genres and although he made his name in the science-fiction genres, he is now exploring a new realm,
    the imaginative realism of aerial landscapes. The iconic artist has been crafting his unique brand of science fiction 
    imagery for decades, and it's all based on physical sensations he's experienced,
    whether through lucid dreaming or meditation. It's the feeling of weightlessness,
    of floating, in particular that gives way to his art,  His work regularly depicts strange floating structures and 
    colliding celestial bodies. His early passion for the genre eventually 
    led to a job painting covers for author Philip Dunn's trilogy Cities in Flight, 
    and in 1985 he was commissioned by NASA to illustrate a rocket launch.
     His work has since been used by a who's who of sci-fi legends, from Isaac Asimov to Jack Vance.
    Over the years he's maintained a consistent yet unique style â€” once you're familiar with it, 
    it's easy to recognize Harris' work.
